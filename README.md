An app I would like to build ia one that chooses a hobby for you. The user will implement interests, risk levels, past experiences, etc. and the system will automate a new hobby to try! Features I'd implement is are pages about diverse hobbies, an aesthetic for each one, and many more. Favorited pages will result in a higher chance of receiving a hobby similar it.
